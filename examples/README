This directory contains some sample programs that use the hrtime library.

print_hrtime	Queries itself and prints out its current high-resolution time
fork_test	Forks off a child process and prints its timing values
syscall_timing	Uses the hrtime library to time a system call (getpid)
query_costs	Computes the cost of calling a libhrtime function

times.*		Sample output from syscall_timing.  As can be seen, enabling
		CONFIG_HRUSTIME (the system call path timing) adds
		approximately 100 cycles of overhead to an approximately 300
		cycle system call.  These measurements were taking on a dual
		Pentium-III 450 with 256MB of memory.

query_cost.PIII450x2 Sample output from syscall_timing. Same machine as above
